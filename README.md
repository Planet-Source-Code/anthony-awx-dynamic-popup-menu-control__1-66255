## Dynamic Popup Menu Control

### Description

This is a usercontrol written in vb6 that enables you to create your own dynamic popup menus.

For example, instead of creating hidden menu's in the menu editor, giving each one a name, or, creating an array of holders for dynamic entries, you can simply do this:

UserChoice = popMenu.Popup("item1,item2,item3")

A seemingly simply thing, but has been quite useful for my projects, so I thought I would pass it on. It started off as a class, but I turned it into a user control so it would be easier to use for beginners.

Hope you find it useful -
